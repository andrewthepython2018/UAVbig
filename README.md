# UAV Projects Pack

Two projects you can upload to GitHub to showcase practical UAV-related skills:

1. **situation_analysis_cv/** â€” a modular situational analysis pipeline for safety monitoring in video.
2. **uav_ground_station/** â€” a lightweight ground station (Streamlit) with mission editor and simulated telemetry.

Each project contains its own README, requirements, and runnable demos.
